      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        Computer is an electronic device device derived from the Latin word "computere" which means
        to calculate. It accepts raw facts and figures as an input which are isolated and
        uninterpreted through input device, process it according to the requirement of the user or
        command supplied by the user, store it before and after processing of require and produce a
        meaningful information as an output through an output device. Generally, computer works on
        IPO (Input-Process-Output) cycle. It follows GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out) algorithm which
        means the output is always based on the input supplied by the user. The basic operation of
        computer is illustrated by following block diagram.

      <h4>
        <strong><u>Some characteristics/features of computer.</u></strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        The implementation of computers are not only limited/confined to a small area rather they
        are used from simple domestic task to complex scientific research to engineering. The use of
        computer are increasing day-by-day due to some special features or characteristics that
        computer own. Several features of computer are:
      </p>
      <ul type="square">
        <li>
          Accuracy: Computer are the accurate machine that means result produced by computer are
          100% accurate. Since, it follows GIGO. The error that may arise in output is due to human
          not by a computer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Speed: Computer works on tremendously high speed. The operating speed of computer are
          measured in&nbsp; millisecond, microsecond, picosecond and nanosecond which means computer
          can perform millions and billions of instruction per second.
        </li>
        <li>
          Storage: It is the area or unit which is capable of storing data and information for
          present and future use. Storing data allows users to retrieve it whenever required. These
          days computer comes with high volume of memory which are measured in Megabyte (1024 KB) ,
          Gigabyte (1024 MB), Terabyte(1024 GB) and Petabyte(1024 TB).
        </li>
        <li>
          Versatility: Computer are generally design to serve more than one type of work. The
          implementation of computer are not only limited to specific purpose, they solve general
          requirement of the user and can be used in more than 1 type of job.
        </li>
        <li>
          Diligence: The feature of computer in which computer doesn't get tired even after working
          for long period of time. Computer can perform any number of task continuously until it is
          accomplished. Once the instruction is given computer follows the command till it gets
          terminated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Automatic: Computer is an automatic machine. Once the instruction is generated it perform
          accordingly until command is terminated. We don't have to issue continuous command in
          order to operate the computer. This is called automatic.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
        <strong><u>Applications/Implementations/Uses of computer</u></strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The uses of computer are increased day by day. Every aspect if human life
        is highly influenced by computer. From simple domestic use to complex engineering and
        scientific solutions, computer can be used. This is due to the versatility of computer. Some
        of the basic implementation of computer are:
      </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>
          Education: Nowadays, computer are highly used in teaching and learning process. Many
          interesting graphics can be made and provided for easy learning. Also, computer provide
          features of internet which make learning easy and fun.
        </li>
        <li>
          Communication: Computer is massively used in communication. Communication is done by
          e-mail, chat, online conferencing. e-fax etc with help of internet in computer. It has
          made the communication faster, easier and cheaper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Business: In business sector, computer are used to generate invoice, maintain stock and
          make statistical analysis. E-commerce is the new and emerging way of buying and selling
          goods and service through used of electronic means and media.
        </li>
        <li>
          Engineering and designing: Scientific and engineering design requires complex and massive
          computations. Design of bridges, towers, buildings, generators, motors, electrical
          transmission etc requires precise computation which are done through computers.
