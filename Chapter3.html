      <h4><strong>Software - Introduction:</strong></h4>
      <p>
        As we know stand alone hardware cannot do nothing, for the smooth operation of our Computer
        System there should be proper coordination between hardware and software. Software helps to
        mobilize the hardware and other&nbsp; resources. In order to mobilize hardware we have to
        write several set of instruction which instruct computer&nbsp; what to do, what not o. These
        set of instruction are collectively know as program and the term software is the collection
        of related programs and&nbsp; associated documents. In Order to produce useful output,
        hardware and software must work together. Nothing useful can be done with the hardware only
        and software cannot be utilize without hardware. The different types of software are:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1) System software:</strong> System software is set of one or more programs designed
        to control the operation of our computer system. This type of software doesn't fulfill the
        specific requirement of the user. They are general program written to assist human in the
        use of the computer system. In general system software support the running of other
        software, communicate with peripheral device, support the development of other types of
        software and monitors the use of various hardware resources. Thus, the system software makes
        the operation of the computer system more effective and efficient. The system software is
        categorized into two categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.1) System Management: </strong>It is responsible for proper management and
        functioning of the computers system. All types of management between computer hardware and
        software is performed by system management software. There are 3 types of system management
        software:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.1.1) Operating System:</strong> Operating system is a collection program that
        controls the overall operation of the computer system. It is the 1st program that is loaded
        into memory when the computer is turned on. It provides platform for other application
        program to run and execute. It provides user with an interface so that uses can easily
        communicate with computer. For example Linux, Windows, Mac etc
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.1.2) Utility software:</strong> It is the supporting software which is used to
        perform specific task related to the maintenance of the computer system. Some&nbsp; of the
        utility software are included in operating system where as some are available as separate
        utility in market. They are also called service program. For example&nbsp; Norton Utility,
        PC tools, win zip etc
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.1.3) Device driver:</strong> A device driver is a software which is responsible
        for smooth functioning of the hardware device that is connected to the computer. When we add
        a new&nbsp; device to the computer, we need to install new software called device driver.
        Device driver will co-ordinate with the operating system and the newly installed hardware
        functions properly and smoothly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.2) System Development:</strong> It refers to set of programs that are use to
        develop computer program. This type of software are not used by a normal user of the
        computes. They are used by programmers for the development of new program. There are two
        types of system development software:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.2.1) Programming language:</strong> The language with which we give instruction to
        the computer is known as programming language. Programming language are the set of different
        keywords, variable, operators, loops and other symbols etc. They help to make communication
        between computer and user. These are two types of programming language low level language
        and high level language.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1.2.2) Language translator:</strong> It is a special kind computer software which
        translates the programs written one language in another language. It is compulsory for both
        low and high level language. It is also called language processor. The types of language
        translator are compiler, interpreter&nbsp; and assembler.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2) Application Software:</strong>&nbsp; Application software is a set of one or more
        program which are design to do a specific task. It is made to fulfill the user demand. This
        program directs a computer to solve user oriented problem such as preparing bills,&nbsp;
        calculating mathematical equation, preparing mark sheet etc. The software that are develop
        for user purpose is called application software.These types of software are generally
        develop by using high level language. for example Ms-Excel, Photoshop, Billing software etc.
        There are two types of application software.<br />&nbsp;<strong
          >2.1) Packaged software:</strong
        >
        They are the generalized set of programs design and develop for general purpose. It is
        generally large sized, error-free, advance and standard software with much more
        functionality fir especial work. This type of software doesn't perfectly match the
        requirement of many organization or user. They cannot be changed easily are developed and
        designed by reputed software Company so they are trust worthy. They are expensive for small
        organization. for example Ms-Office, Adobe, Macromedia etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2.2) Customized /Tailored software:</strong> This is a software develop in high
        level language for special task. This types of software is developed for some specific
        purpose for solving specific problem of specific user or organization. The requirement on
        the user or organization can be perfectly matched. They can be changed easily since they are
        made by local programmer. for example: payroll system, inventory management, school
        management, billing software, mark sheet evaluation etc.
